# KillerWhalesBot
Discord bot for KillerWhale server

## Installation

Will be added later

## Environment variables

A .env file is intentionally missing in the files as it is the file where you store the bot token and the server name.
It should be created in the src directory with the following content :

```bash
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN={DISCORD_TOKEN}
DISCORD_GUILD={SERVER_NAME}
```

Replace {DISCORD_TOKEN} and {SERVER_NAME} with their values
